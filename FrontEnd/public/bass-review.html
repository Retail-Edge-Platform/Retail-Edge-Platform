The shipping took forever as they company appears to save freight costs by grind up the item using a woodchipper and using the powder that comes out as cushioning material in mattresses. I received it on Thursday and followed the assembly instructions religiously.  The company was kind enough to supply excellent instructions and a 55-gallon barrel of glue. After assembly I tried to get some music out of it but not a peep. What is the world coming to when they make cinder block holders so cheap?

Boy, was I surprised when after receiving the self-opening package it installed itself!!!!! My neighbors came over right away and said, 'how do you get it done so fast?' I told him a story about how I'm friends with Santa and he let me sub-contract some Christmas Elves.  The neighbor bought it.
