This project uses Docker to setup a fictional data analysis pipeline.

## Simple Example Model
Below is a diagram of a fictional data analysis pipeline as built.

Here is how it is built.

## Future

 * It would be easy to expand this with an OpenCV container and provide people and facial detection to start to gather real analytics.
 * Adding a IOT MQTT end-point to AWS or GCP would be very easy. This would allow further anaysis off the Edge device.
 * As to the edge device an Intel NUC would be more than enough. A USB video camera like an Intel Real Sense L515 would work nicely.
 * To keep cost down and make development easier load it with Linux, Docker or K8S. Edge management could be either AWS or other.
 * As to developing content my other project B4Time uses draw.io/diagram.net to allow computer architects to model a system.  This same plugin approach could allow a skilled graphics artist to design the user experience and deploy it without the need to involve a UI developer.
 * Retail experience could be packaged in a stylish and in expensive furniture shell allowing the customer to access the content through a touch screen while also allwoing access to product. 
 * The product could be a pay as you go model with sales inspired by the interface paying for the subscription.
